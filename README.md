# ![logo](./assets/32x32.png) BlocksTracker Backend

This is the backend service for [BlocksTracker](https://blocks-tracker.com/), a privacy-first habit and task tracking app. Built with Go, PostgreSQL, and Redis.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Go** (Gin)
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Redis**
- **Docker Compose** for local development

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before running the services, you must create a configuration file for `air`, our live-reloading tool. An example file is provided for you. Copy it to create your local configuration:

```bash
cp air.example.toml .air.toml
```

Once that's done, you can build and run the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## 🔑 Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables to be set. You can create a `.env` file in the root of the project, and `docker-compose` will automatically use it.

- `DB_USER`: The username for the PostgreSQL database.
- `DB_PASSWORD`: The password for the PostgreSQL database.
- `DB_NAME`: The name of the PostgreSQL database.
- `TEST_DB_NAME`: The name of the PostgreSQL database to use for integration tests.
- `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`: The secret key for signing JWT access tokens.
- `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`: The secret key for signing JWT refresh tokens.
- `REDIS_PASSWORD`: Password for the Redis server (leave empty if none).
